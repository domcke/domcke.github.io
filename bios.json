        "bio": "Silvia is an Assistant Professor at the University of Zurich. Her curiosity to understand gene regulation has led her to the Technical University of Munich, Harvard Medical School in Boston, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, the FMI in Basel, and the University of Washington in Seattle. From bench to byte, she has worked on various aspects of single cell genomics, including leading a computational team at a Silicon Valley drug discovery start-up.",
        "extra": "Silvia's love for exploring the unknown goes beyond the cellular landscape: she's also a passionate ski mountaineer, alpine climber and wilderness adventurer.",

        "bio": "During her PhD at the University of Zurich, Giulia developed a targeted scRNA-seq method and applied it across multiple biological systems, with a strong focus on Cancer Biology. Now joining the Domcke lab as a Postdoctoral Researcher, she is excited to further develop novel genomic technologies. Passionate about all stages of method development — from wet-lab experiments to design of computational pipelines — she enjoys bridging experimental and computational approaches to advance genomic research and better understand gene regulation.",
        "extra": "Beyond the lab, Giulia’s curiosity drives her to explore new places while traveling, try new recipes while baking, and immerse herself in nature — always seeking new adventures and discoveries.",
